Requirements
------------

- Python >= 3.10
- A running XCP slave (of course)
- If you are using a 64-bit Windows version and want to use seed-and-key
  .dlls (to unlock resources), a GCC compiler capable of creating 32-bit
  executables is required. These .dlls almost always ship as 32-bit
  versions, but you can’t load a 32-bit .dll into a 64-bit process, so a
  small bridging program (asamkeydll.exe) is required.
