# pyXCP Tutorial

This tutorial will guide you through the basics of using the pyXCP library to communicate with XCP-enabled devices.

## Introduction

pyXCP is a Python library for communicating with devices that support the XCP (Universal Measurement and Calibration Protocol) protocol. XCP is commonly used in automotive applications for calibration, measurement, and flashing of ECUs (Electronic Control Units).

## Installation

Install pyXCP from PyPI:

```shell
pip install pyxcp
```

For building from source and development details, see the project README.

## Basic Usage

### Before you start

- Prerequisites: An XCP slave (ECU, device, or simulator), and ideally its A2L file (ASAM MCD‑2 MC). The A2L maps symbolic names to addresses, data types, and conversions used for calibration/measurement. Without an A2L you can still work with raw addresses.
- Safety: XCP is for development and testing. Avoid enabling measurement/calibration on safety‑critical systems unless your safety case covers it. Prefer a lab setup for first steps.
- Transport choice: pyXCP supports Ethernet, CAN, USB, and Serial (SxI). Ethernet usually offers the highest throughput; CAN is ubiquitous and robust but has limited payload. See also docs/howto_can_driver.md for CAN setup.

### Choose your transport (quick guide)

- Ethernet (TCP): If your device exposes XCP on TCP, you’ll typically specify host/port.
- CAN: Requires a python‑can compatible driver and correct CAN IDs/filters. Use pyxcp‑probe‑can‑drivers to list available interfaces. See docs/howto_can_driver.md.
- USB/Serial: Device‑specific; consult your device documentation.

You can configure transports either by command line via the built‑in ArgumentParser or via the traitlets configuration system (see Configuration below).

### CLI quick wins

Try these before writing code:

```bash
# Discover basic capabilities and negotiated options
xcp-info -t eth --host 127.0.0.1 --port 5555

# Scan for identifier packets (e.g., on CAN)
xcp-id-scanner -t can --driver kvaser --channel 0 --bitrate 500000

# Attempt to fetch A2L from the target if supported
xcp-fetch-a2l -t eth --host 127.0.0.1 --port 5555 -o my_ecu.a2l

# See available demos
xcp-examples -h
```

### Connecting to an XCP Slave

The most basic operation is to connect to an XCP slave device and retrieve information about it:

```python
from pyxcp.cmdline import ArgumentParser

# Create an argument parser that handles common XCP connection parameters
ap = ArgumentParser(description="pyXCP hello world example")

# Use a context manager to ensure proper cleanup
with ap.run() as x:
    # Connect to the XCP slave
    x.connect()

    # Get the slave identifier
    identifier = x.identifier(0x01)
    print(f"ID: {identifier!r}")

    # Print slave properties
    print(x.slaveProperties)

    # Disconnect when done
    x.disconnect()
```

The `ArgumentParser` class handles command-line arguments for specifying the transport layer (CAN, Ethernet, USB, etc.) and connection parameters.

#### Examples: Ethernet and CAN invocations

- Ethernet (TCP):

```bash
python your_script.py -t eth --host 127.0.0.1 --port 5555 --protocol TCP
```

- CAN (Kvaser example):

```bash
python your_script.py -t can --driver kvaser --channel 0 --bitrate 500000 \
  --can-id-master 0x300 --can-id-slave 0x301
```

Tip: If you prefer config files, you can omit many CLI flags and specify them in a traitlets config (see Configuration below). Use `xcp-profile create -o my_config.py` to generate a template.

### Configuration

pyXCP supports two configuration systems:

#### Traitlets-based Configuration (Recommended)

The recommended way to configure pyXCP is using the traitlets-based configuration system with Python configuration files:

```bash
# Connect using a Python configuration file
python your_script.py -t eth --config path/to/config.py
```

Example Python configuration file (config.py):

```python
# Configuration file for pyXCP
c = get_config()  # noqa

# Transport configuration
c.Transport.layer = "ETH"

# Ethernet configuration
c.Transport.Eth.host = "localhost"
c.Transport.Eth.port = 5555
c.Transport.Eth.protocol = "TCP"
```

You can generate a template configuration file with all available options:

```bash
xcp-profile create -o my_config.py
```

#### Legacy TOML Configuration

The older TOML-based configuration is still supported but is now considered legacy:

```bash
# Connect using legacy TOML configuration
python your_script.py -t eth --config path/to/config.toml
```

Example legacy configuration file for Ethernet (conf_eth.toml):

```toml
[XCP]
TRANSPORT = "ETH"

[ETH]
HOST = "localhost"
PORT = 5555
PROTOCOL = "TCP"
```

Example legacy configuration file for CAN (conf_can.toml):

```toml
[XCP]
TRANSPORT = "CAN"

[CAN]
CHANNEL = 0
BITRATE = 500000
```

You can convert a legacy configuration file to the new format:

```bash
xcp-profile convert -c old_config.toml -o new_config.py
```

## Data Acquisition (DAQ)

XCP supports data acquisition for collecting measurement data from the slave device.

Concepts recap: The slave exposes events (e.g., "1 ms task") that drive sampling. You configure one or more DAQ lists and ODTs, assign them to events, and optionally enable timestamps for precise correlation. DTO size and bandwidth depend on the negotiated transport parameters.

Note: For a higher-level DAQ workflow using Policies (online CSV and offline .xmraw recording) and post-processing,
see the Recorder page: [Recorder](recorder.md). The snippet below demonstrates a low-level DAQ setup directly with the master API:

```python
from pyxcp.cmdline import ArgumentParser
from pyxcp.recorder import XcpLogFileWriter

ap = ArgumentParser(description="pyXCP DAQ example")

with ap.run() as x:
    x.connect()

    # Configure DAQ
    x.cond_unlock()

    # Get DAQ information
    daq_info = x.getDaqInfo()

    # Set up a DAQ list
    x.setDaqPtr(0, 0, 0)
    x.writeDaq(0x1234)  # Address to measure

    # Start DAQ
    x.startStopDaqList(0, 1)
    x.startStopSynch(1)

    # Create a recorder to save data
    recorder = XcpLogFileWriter("measurement.xmraw")
    x.set_recorder(recorder)

    # Wait for data
    import time
    time.sleep(5)

    # Stop DAQ
    x.startStopSynch(0)
    recorder.close()

    x.disconnect()
```

## Calibration

XCP allows you to read and write parameters in the slave device:

```python
from pyxcp.cmdline import ArgumentParser

ap = ArgumentParser(description="pyXCP calibration example")

with ap.run() as x:
    x.connect()

    # Unlock the slave for calibration
    x.cond_unlock()

    # Read a value
    address = 0x1234
    size = 4  # bytes
    data = x.upload(size, address)
    print(f"Value at 0x{address:X}: {int.from_bytes(data, byteorder='little')}")

    # Write a value
    new_value = 42
    x.download(address, new_value.to_bytes(size, byteorder='little'))

    x.disconnect()
```

## Advanced Features

### Using Custom Transport Layers

pyXCP supports various transport layers, and you can also create custom ones:

```python
from pyxcp.cmdline import ArgumentParser
from pyxcp.transport.can import CanInterfaceBase

# Create a custom CAN interface
class MyCanInterface(CanInterfaceBase):
    def __init__(self, config):
        super().__init__(config)
        # Initialize your custom CAN hardware

    def transmit(self, payload):
        # Implement sending data
        pass

    def receive(self, timeout=None):
        # Implement receiving data
        pass

    def close(self):
        # Clean up resources
        pass

# Register your custom interface
from pyxcp.transport.can import register_can_interface
register_can_interface("my_can", MyCanInterface)

# Now you can use it in your configuration
# [CAN]
# DRIVER = "my_can"
```


### Upgrading an Existing Configuration

You can convert a legacy configuration file (TOML/JSON) to the new Python/traitlets format using the xcp-profile tool:

```shell
xcp-profile convert -c old_config.toml -o new_config.py
```

Note on CAN identifier parameters (issue #130): The new configuration system interprets CAN IDs via

```python
c.Transport.Can.can_id_master = 47
c.Transport.Can.can_id_slave = 11
```

correctly. For compatibility, existing legacy files continue to behave as before; when you convert a legacy file,
ID roles are normalized in the generated Python config. The logger illustrates the resolved IDs at runtime, for example:

```text
2024-08-06 16:25:54 INFO     XCPonCAN - Interface-Type: 'kvaser' Parameters: [('channel', '0'), ('fd', False), ('bitrate', 500000),
                             ('receive_own_messages', False), ('sjw', 2), ('tseg1', 5), ('tseg2', 2)]
                    INFO     XCPonCAN - Master-ID (Tx): 0x00000300S -- Slave-ID (Rx): 0x00000301S
2024-08-06 16:25:55 INFO     XCPonCAN - Filters used: [{'can_id': 769, 'can_mask': 2047, 'extended': False}]
                    INFO     XCPonCAN - State: BusState.ACTIVE
```

### Unlocking via Seed & Key (Python)

Instead of a DLL, you can provide a Python function for Seed & Key handling:

```python
def SeedKeyXCP(resource: int, seed: bytes) -> bytes:
    temp0, temp1, temp2, temp3 = seed[0], seed[1], seed[2], seed[3]
    temp = (temp3 << 24) | (temp2 << 16) | (temp1 << 8) | temp0
    temp = (temp >> 5) | (temp << 23)
    temp = (temp * 7) ^ 0x26031961

    key = bytearray(9)
    key[0] = (temp >> 0) & 0xFF
    key[1] = (temp >> 8) & 0xFF
    key[2] = (temp >> 16) & 0xFF
    key[3] = (temp >> 24) & 0xFF
    return bytes(key)

# c.General.seed_n_key_dll = 'SeedNKeyXcp.dll'  # alternative
c.General.seed_n_key_function = SeedKeyXCP
```

### Re‑using an existing CAN interface

If you already manage a CAN bus object externally, you can pass it into pyXCP. See HOW‑TO: How to build your own CAN drivers (howto_can_driver.md) for a full example and caveats.

### Timestamping note

Timestamps are generated by a C++ extension. The application start timestamp (including timezone and offsets) is available on the context:

```python
with ap.run() as x:
    print("Start DT:", x.start_datetime)
```

## Flashing / Programming (overview)

Flashing support depends on the slave's programming algorithm and the A2L description. pyXCP provides the building blocks (CONNECT, PROGRAM_RESET, ERASE, DOWNLOAD, VERIFY, checksums), but the exact sequence and memory layout are slave‑specific.

- Always back up calibration data where applicable.
- Verify negotiated options (e.g., checksum type, max DTO) with `xcp-info` before large transfers.
- Consult your A2L for programming sections and address granularity.
- For safety, test on a simulator or development device first.

## Troubleshooting

- Timeouts on connect: Check transport parameters (host/port for ETH; channel/bitrate and filters for CAN). Use `xcp-info` or `xcp-id-scanner` to validate connectivity.
- Seed & Key fails: Confirm you provided the correct DLL or Python function. On Windows with 32‑bit only DLLs, use the provided 32↔64 bridge (asamkeydll.exe). See README and docs/configuration.md.
- Wrong or swapped CAN IDs: Ensure `can_id_master` and `can_id_slave` are set correctly (see Configuration). The logger prints resolved IDs.
- DTO too large: Reduce number/size of signals in DAQ lists or increase event period; confirm max DTO via `xcp-info`.
- A2L mismatch: Ensure the A2L matches the firmware build; symbolic access depends on correct addresses and conversions.
