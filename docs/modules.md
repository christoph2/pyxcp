# API Documentation

The Sphinx API pages remain under the `docs` folder. For quick browsing on GitHub, start with:

- [pyxcp package overview](pyxcp.rst)

Note: These `.rst` API pages use Sphinx directives (automodule, etc.) and are intended for building HTML docs. They still render as plain text on GitHub.
